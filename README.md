# Brief description
Review unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that
the data fits into. Use multiple algorithms and both empirically and
theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Make predictions about the
natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then check these
predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
